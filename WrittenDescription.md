1. Tumor volume increased anywhere from 46% to 57% on average over 45 days in the face of all treatments except for Capomulin which saw a 19% decrease over the 45-day period.


2. Mice receiving the Capomulin treatment experienced less metastatic spread over the 45-day period.  Infubinol significantly reduced metastatic spread compared to Ketapril and Placebo but was not nearly as effective ad Capomulin.

3. While Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo groups lost over half their population over the 45 days, the Capomulin group only lost 4 participants (16%).  Capomulin was better than other drugs and the placebo at both increasing Survival Rate and Reducing Tumor Volume.
